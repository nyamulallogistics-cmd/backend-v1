# Nyamula Logistics Backend - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

This backend provides **complete, production-ready API support** for both the Cargo Owner and Transporter dashboard interfaces shown in your React components.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Post Load Functionality** (Cargo Owner)
Complete support for the `PostLoad.tsx` component:

- ✅ Detailed cargo information (type, description, weight, dimensions)
- ✅ Pickup and delivery locations with full addresses
- ✅ Date selection for pickup and delivery
- ✅ Estimated value and insurance requirements
- ✅ Special handling instructions
- ✅ Automatic quote expiration (default 7 days)
- ✅ Automatic distance calculation placeholder

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/quotes`

### 2. **Shipments Management** (Both Roles)
Complete support for the `Shipments.tsx` component:

- ✅ View active shipments with real-time progress (0-100%)
- ✅ View completed shipments with delivery confirmation
- ✅ Search and filter by location, status, cargo
- ✅ Driver information (name, phone, truck number)
- ✅ Last update tracking with timestamps
- ✅ Shipment statistics (active, in-transit, completed, total value)
- ✅ Automatic completion tracking

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/shipments` - All shipments with filters
- `GET /api/shipments/active` - Active shipments only
- `GET /api/shipments/completed` - Completed shipments only
- `GET /api/shipments/stats` - Statistics summary
- `PATCH /api/shipments/:id` - Update shipment (status, progress, location)

### 3. **Dashboard Statistics** (Both Roles)

#### Cargo Owner Dashboard
- ✅ Active shipments count with awaiting pickup breakdown
- ✅ In-transit shipments count
- ✅ Monthly spending totals
- ✅ Pending quotes with expiration tracking
- ✅ Recent quotes with bid information
- ✅ Active shipments list with progress

#### Transporter Dashboard
- ✅ Active deliveries with pending pickup count
- ✅ Available loads (quotes not yet bid on)

- ✅ Total completed trips (all-time + this month)
- ✅ Recent deliveries list
- ✅ Available loads with bid counts

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Role-based dashboard

### 4. **Quote & Bidding System**
- ✅ Create detailed quotes (post loads)
- ✅ Browse active quotes (transporters)
- ✅ Place competitive bids
- ✅ View all bids on a quote
- ✅ Accept bids (cargo owners)
- ✅ Automatic shipment creation on bid acceptance
- ✅ Quote expiration handling

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/quotes` - Create quote
- `GET /api/quotes` - List quotes (role-based)

### 5. **Enhanced Data Models**

#### Shipment Model
```typescript
{
  cargo, cargoDescription,
  fromLocation, fromAddress,
  toLocation, toAddress,
  status, amount, eta, progress,
  weight, distance, dimensions,
  pickupDate, deliveryDate, completedAt,
  driverName, driverPhone, truckNumber,
  lastUpdate, lastUpdateTime,
  cargoOwner, transporter, quote
}
```

#### Quote Model
```typescript
{
  cargo, cargoType, cargoDescription,
  fromLocation, fromAddress,
  toLocation, toAddress,
  weight, distance, dimensions,
  estimatedValue, insuranceRequired,
  specialInstructions,
  pickupDate, deliveryDate,
  status, expiresAt,
  cargoOwner, bids
}
```

## 🔌 Frontend Integration

### Quick Example

```typescript
// Post a load
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/quotes', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    cargo: 'Mining Equipment',
    cargoType: 'mining',
    cargoDescription: 'Heavy machinery',
    weight: 15000, // kg
    fromLocation: 'Lusaka',
    fromAddress: '123 Industrial Area',
    toLocation: 'Ndola',
    toAddress: '456 Mining Site',
    pickupDate: '2024-02-01T08:00:00Z',
    deliveryDate: '2024-02-03T17:00:00Z',
    dimensions: '6 x 2.4 x 2.6',
    estimatedValue: 50000,
    insuranceRequired: true,
    specialInstructions: 'Requires flatbed truck',
  }),
});

// Get dashboard
const dashboard = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
});

// Update shipment progress
await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/shipments/${id}`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    progress: 65,
    lastUpdate: 'Kasama - 2 hours ago',
  }),
});
```

## 📊 Workflow Example

### Complete Load-to-Delivery Flow

1. **Cargo Owner Posts Load**
   ```
   POST /api/quotes
   → Creates quote with all details
   → Status: ACTIVE
   ```

2. **Transporters View & Bid**
   ```
   GET /api/quotes (transporters)
   → See available loads
   
   POST /api/quotes/:id/bids
   → Place competitive bids
   ```

3. **Cargo Owner Accepts Bid**
   ```
   POST /api/quotes/:quoteId/bids/:bidId/accept
   → Automatically creates shipment
   → Quote status: ACCEPTED
   → Shipment status: PENDING_PICKUP
   ```

4. **Transporter Updates Shipment**
   ```
   PATCH /api/shipments/:id
   { status: 'IN_TRANSIT', progress: 0, pickupDate: '...' }
   → Shipment status: IN_TRANSIT
   
   PATCH /api/shipments/:id
   { progress: 50, lastUpdate: 'Halfway point' }
   → Progress tracking
   
   PATCH /api/shipments/:id
   { status: 'DELIVERED', progress: 100 }
   → Shipment status: DELIVERED
   → completedAt automatically set
   ```

5. **Statistics Update**
   ```
   All dashboards automatically reflect:
   - Updated shipment counts
   - Monthly earnings/spending
   - Completed trip counts
   ```
